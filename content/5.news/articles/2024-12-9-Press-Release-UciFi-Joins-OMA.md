_Combined Organization to Add New Focus on “Smart City” Technical Specifications Development to Further Extend Interoperability_

[OMA SpecWorks](https://www.openmobilealliance.org/) and the [uCIFI® Alliance](https://ucifi.org/) announce today that uCIFI® has transferred its specification-setting work to OMA SpecWorks, establishing a new “Smart City” Working Group that will be created within OMA.  
uCIFI®'s initial mission focused on creating a data model to represent objects and use cases for Smart Cities in an open format, enabling true interoperability between devices and applications.

The latest release of a series of new Lightweight Machine-to-Machine (LwM2M) objects on the OMA LwM2M registry marks a significant stride toward enriched interoperability and standardized communication in smart city applications and IoT devices. With this latest update on the uCIFI® data model, the mission of the uCIFI® Alliance to develop and publish an open unified data model leveraging existing standards has been achieved.  

>**We see this evolution under the OMA SpecWorks umbrella as a strategic partnership that will ensure the uCIFI® data model stays relevant, up-to-date, and benefits from a strong alliance**.— Louis-Frédéric Robin, Chairperson of uCIFI® Board of Directors

“With the publication of the uCIFI® data model, our mission is accomplished" said Louis-Frédéric Robin, Chairperson of uCIFI® Board of Directors, “With the rapid evolution of IoT network technologies, uCIFI® has chosen to stay network-agnostic, allowing the industry to determine the best-suited technologies for different applications. We see this evolution under the OMA SpecWorks umbrella as a strategic partnership that will ensure the uCIFI® data model stays relevant, up-to-date, and benefits from a strong alliance.”  

The uCIFI® data model vision will continue with certification programs under OMA. A new “Smart City” Working Group will be specifically created within the OMA work program and the uCIFI® data model will continue to be developed by the Smart City Working Group at the OMA. Both uCIFI® and OMA SpecWorks have become influential organizations in the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart city sectors, promoting standards that enhance interoperability and accelerate market growth. The transfer of uCIFI® specification-setting work to OMA SpecWorks consolidates a strong position in the IoT ecosystem, supporting the advancement towards interoperability and standardization.

“By joining forces and leveraging the Lightweight M2M (LwM2M) technology into the connected lighting and smart cities markets, we will be able to reach a wider audience and facilitate the adoption of smart city technologies on a global scale. The OMA Board, represented by Matthew Gillmore (Itron) and Scott Migaldi (TMUS) are delighted to welcome our new colleagues from uCIFI®, and we look forward to the innovative ideas and fresh perspectives they will bring as we embark on this exciting journey together.“

### About OMA
OMA SpecWorks brings together leading industry players to create multi-vendor interoperability for Internet of Things (IoT) devices through the development and promotion of voluntary, consensus-based technical standards and specifications. As a non-profit entity with deep roots in mobile and IoT innovation, OMA SpecWorks has been instrumental in the development of key protocols, most notably Lightweight M2M (LwM2M). This protocol has become a cornerstone for IoT device management, enabling efficient and secure communication between devices across diverse wireless networks.

By merging with the IPSO Alliance in 2018, OMA SpecWorks further strengthened its mission to develop comprehensive technical documents—ranging from specifications to smart objects to thought leadership in connecting assets, devices, and cities—supporting the ongoing evolution of the connected world and advancing IoT device management.
