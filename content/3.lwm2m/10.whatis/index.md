The [Open Mobile Alliance Lightweight M2M (OMA LwM2M)](/lwm2m/applications-use-cases#lwm2m-messaging-procol) protocol is a communication protocol designed for managing devices in the Internet of Things (IoT). It provides a standard way to remotely manage and communicate with constrained devices, such as sensors and actuators, which often have limited processing power and memory.

  About LwM2M
subtitle: 
text: |
  The [**Lightweight Machine-to-Machine (LwM2M)**](/lwm2m/applications-use-cases#lwm2m-messaging-procol) protocol is a specialized Internet of Things device management protocol, which was initially designed for use with constrained devices and constrained networks in the Internet of Things (IoT). It is, however, also successfully used on high-end IoT devices as well. LwM2M is deployed in a variety of verticals, such as smart energy, building automation, precision farming, logistics, etc. The object and resource model defined for LwM2M allows extensibility while maintaining interoperability. More than 300 objects and resources have been specified to retrieve sensor data, control actuators, and manage application data. These objects and resources are free to use and publically available.
