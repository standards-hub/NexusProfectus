## Features

### 1. Device Management 
* LwM2M facilitates remote management of devices, including firmware updates, configuration changes, and diagnostics.

### 2. Interoperability 
* It ensures interoperability between devices from different manufacturers by providing a standardized framework for device management and communication.

### 3. Efficient Data Transmission 
* LwM2M is optimized for low-power devices and networks with limited bandwidth, using efficient data encoding and transport protocols.

### 4. Security: 
* It incorporates security features such as authentication and encryption to protect data and devices from unauthorized access.

### 5. Resource Model
* SLwM2M uses a resource model where each device can expose a set of resources (e.g., temperature sensor reading, battery level) that can be accessed or manipulated by the server.
