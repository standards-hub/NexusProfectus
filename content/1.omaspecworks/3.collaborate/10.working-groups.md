    The **OMA Working Groups** foster collaboration across industries to enhance the **Lightweight M2M (LwM2M)** protocol, driving efficient IoT management solutions. By uniting efforts, these groups focus on improving interoperability, outreach, and the deployment of new IoT applications, particularly within the utility sector.

### DMSO
* The **Device Management & Smart Objects (DMSO)** Working Group, a merger of the former OMA DMSO and OMA IPSO groups, is responsible for the design, development, and maintenance of the **Lightweight M2M (LwM2M)** protocol. This protocol is widely used for managing mobile devices, service access, and software updates across Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Since 2002, the DMSO WG has released over 20 mobile service enabler specifications and more than 60 Management Objects (MOs), providing cost-effective solutions for deploying new IoT applications while minimizing risks.

### Utility Outreach
* The **DM-IoT Utility Outreach Working Group** focuses on increasing awareness and engagement with **OMA LwM2M** among utility sector stakeholders, including electric, gas, energy, and water companies. With an estimated 80% of LwM2M implementations in this industry, many utility implementers face challenges due to fragmented deployments and lack of awareness that OMA is the source of the specification. This working group aims to develop outreach programs and resources to encourage active participation from utility stakeholders in refining the LwM2M specification and test cases. It serves as the foundation for the subsequent technical **Utility Interoperability Working Group**, which will address specific interoperability improvements.

### Utility Interoperability

* The **DM-IoT Utility Interoperability (DM-IoT Utility Interop) Working Group** focuses on enhancing the interoperability of **OMA LwM2M** implementations within the utility sector, which includes electric, gas, energy, and water utilities. With over 80% of current LwM2M deployments found in this industry, many utility stakeholders face challenges due to disparate implementations of the specification. This working group builds upon the work of the previous Utility Outreach WG by identifying utility-specific requirements and use cases, passing relevant contributions to other OMA working groups to improve the LwM2M specification and its objects for better industry-wide interoperability.
