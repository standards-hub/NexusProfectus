## A Glimpse at OMA’s Legacy Membership Structure (2002–2024)
For over two decades, OMA’s membership has enabled active participation and voting privileges within a structured framework. Membership distinctions were defined as follows:

- **Sponsor Members** hold a seat on the Board of Directors, possess the right to sponsor new work items, and have the ability to vote on technical matters in the Plenary and Working Groups.

- **Full Members** enjoy the same rights as Sponsor Members but do not automatically hold a Board seat. However, they may stand for election to the Board.

- **Associate Members** have contribution rights and voting privileges within the Working Groups.

- **Supporter Members** have contribution rights within the Working Groups but do not possess voting rights.

As we transition to the updated framework in 2025, OMA SpecWorks remains committed to fostering collaboration, advancing standards, and delivering value to its members.
