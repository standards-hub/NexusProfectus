### All OMA members operate under the same IPR policy.

* In the course of specifications work, the Open Mobile Alliance receives contributions in various forms. To best facilitate the dissemination of these contributions, it is necessary to understand any intellectual property rights (‘IPR’) relating to the contributions.
* Each Open Mobile Alliance member has agreed to use reasonable endeavors to inform the Open Mobile Alliance in a timely manner of Essential IPR as it becomes aware that the Essential IPR is related to the prepared or published specification. However, the members do not have an obligation to conduct IPR searches. The information received by the members is publicly available to members and non-members of the Open Mobile Alliance and may be found on the IPR Declarations lists on these pages.
* Essential IPR is defined and is available for license as set forth in the schedule to the Open Mobile Alliance Application Form.
* Your acceptance of this Agreement does not allow you to provide any contribution of information, whether such contains or does not contain IPR, to the Documents unless you are a member of the Open Mobile Alliance. All contributions must be made pursuant to the membership policies of the Open Mobile Alliance, including but not limited to its IPR policies.
