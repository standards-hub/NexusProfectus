### Affiliate Logos  

With the integration of the SyncML Initiative and Wireless Village into OMA in November 2002, there is no longer any new allowed usage of the SyncML logo and trademark, or the Wireless Village logo and trademark. Products since the time of such integration that have passed SyncML or Wireless Village interoperability testing may not be identified by the use of the SyncML or Wireless Village logos. Additionally, there is no current provision for the OMA logo to be used in conjunction with the results of interoperability or conformance certification testing.  

Information on the use of the WAP Forum logo and trademark may be found in the trademark Usage Requirements.
