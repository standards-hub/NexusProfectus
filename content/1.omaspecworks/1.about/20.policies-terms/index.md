### Openness Policy
Maintaining an open organization is key to OMA’s vision for broad industry participation and adoption. Being able to see and comment on early versions of documents and contributions allows external organizations to be more involved in and aware of evolving service enablers. In support of this, OMA has established an Openness policy ensuring public availability of a vast majority of the documents produced within the OMA Technical Plenary. These documents are made available for members and non-members.
