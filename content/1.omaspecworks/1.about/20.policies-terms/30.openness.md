Maintaining an open organization is key to OMA's vision for broad industry participation and adoption. Being able to see and comment on early versions of documents and contributions allows external organizations to be more involved in and aware of evolving service enablers. In support of this, OMA has established an Openness policy ensuring public availability of a vast majority of the documents produced within the OMA Technical Plenary. These documents are made available for members and non-members.  

In addition to the OMA Enabler Releases which are automatically made publicly available, OMA has made available to the general public documents such as: organization charts, Working Group charters, OMA work program, draft and approved specifications, problem reports, change requests, member input contributions, and high-level test scenarios.  

These documents can be found within the <a href="/specifications/search" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Release Program</a> of the OMA website.
