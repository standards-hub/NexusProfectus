## Search Details

::ShAlert
**Search OMA Specifications:** The Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) offers over 220 Enablers across multiple release versions. Users can quickly access technical specifications by searching via document title, keyword, or type, or by browsing documents related to specific projects or Enablers. These search tools make it easy to find and utilize OMA's extensive resources.
::

Finding the right documents for each OMA Enabler Release is now easier and more efficient. Follow these steps to find the documentation you need:

1. **Search by Enabler Name**: Enter the name of the Enabler in the search bar. For more accurate results, include specific terms related to the Enabler's functionality or release version.

    * **Example**: For documents related to the "Messaging" Enabler, you might search for "Messaging Enabler v1.2".

2. **Filter Your Results**: Use the advanced filtering options to narrow down your search. You can filter by:

    * **Version**: Specify the version of the Enabler.
    * **Status**: Choose between approved, candidate, or historic releases.
    * **Document Type**: Select the type of document, such as technical specifications, guidelines, or release notes.

3. **Keyword Search**: Use keywords related to the content you need. This can include terms from the document's scope or key features of the Enabler.

> Note: The publications listed in this table include the approved versions for each OMA Enabler and the latest candidates for release versions that still need approval.

> Note: Within the Enabler filter column, the assigned number for each Enabler represents the number of associated documents for that search.
