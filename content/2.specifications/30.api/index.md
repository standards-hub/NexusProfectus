### OMA API Inventory
This section showcases the API specifications managed by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), organized by protocol bindings such as RESTful, SOAP Web Services, and LDAP. You'll find a comprehensive list of APIs under each protocol binding, with detailed descriptions to help you navigate and understand their functions. This inventory serves as a resource for easily accessing and comprehending the available APIs and their uses.

* **RESTful APIs**: These APIs use the REST architectural style with an HTTP protocol binding. API operations are mapped to HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), allowing clients to query or modify the current state of a resource.

* **SOAP Web Services APIs**: These APIs utilize a SOAP binding, where API operations and their input parameters are encapsulated within an XML document sent via an HTTP POST method.

* **LDAP APIs**: These APIs bind operations to specific LDAP messages, such as AddRequest, SearchRequest, ModifyRequest, and DelRequest, to perform directory services tasks.
