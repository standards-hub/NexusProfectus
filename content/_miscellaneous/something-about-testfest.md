#### Collaborate

We invite all to collaborate with us in improving or knowledge base.

#### Prerequisites for a TestFest

TestFests are open to the public, as long as you fulfill the following criteria
for entry to the event:

* You have a unique implementation of an OMA Enabler, developed by the company
or in direct association with a third party
* You have implemented all mandatory features of the Enabler to be tested
* You have passed any entry conformance or other preparatory tests defined for
the event, listed in the appendix section of the Enabler Test Specifications:
`Entry Criteria for a TestFest`
* You have signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), provided by OMA, prior to
attending the TestFest

#### Registering for a TestFest

The registration link for each event will be included with the TestEvent date
and location on this TestFest homepage. During registration, you will be asked
to select which OMA SpecWorks Enabler you will be testing and if you are a
Client or Server. The specified fee for that event will be due upon registering
and the event information will inform you what the fee covers / includes for the
event.

Once registration closes, OMA SpecWorks staff will create a formal testing
agenda that will be distributed to participants on-site. More detailed travel
and event information, including recommendations on where to stay, a general
overview of the schedule, arriving at the TestFest, and what to expect on-site,
will be distributed via email to all participants as registration is in progress
and once registration closes.

Participating teams may download the test material to be used during the event
under each Enabler.

#### Reporting Test Session Results

When on-site, the Client teams will be required to complete a Test Session
Report for each test session, verified by the Server team. These reports record
the results that apply to all of the test cases that are part of the Enabler
Test Specification defined by the members. Each report is confidential to the
companies participating in that session.

At the end of the TestFest, OMA SpecWorks publicly posts the results of the
event on the [TestFest Events](https://guidelines.openmobilealliance.org/testfests){target="_blank"}
page via a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/dmse-documentation/tree/master/content/en){target="_blank"}.
In the table you will see:

* Who is the Event host, (_if you are interesting in hosting an event please_
_contact the_ [_staff_](https://omaspecworks.org/contact-us/){target="_blank"})
* Physical location of the Event,
* Date of the Event,
* Consolidated test results for all the participants, _available for download
in PDF_, and
* Individual results per company, implementation and version. _See Product
Listing_ below.

The consolidated report provides an indication to the OMA Working Group of both,
the completeness of the Specification as well as the quality of the
implementations that are being tested. Based on the consolidated results from
more than one TestFest Event, the Working Group may decide to formally Approved
the Technical Specifications.

Lastly, OMA SpecWorks hosts a [Product Listing](https://guidelines.openmobilealliance.org/listing){target="_blank"}
page in a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/dmse-documentation/tree/master/content/en){target="_blank"}
where companies have the opportunity to market the implementation that has been
tested.

#### Reporting Issues with the Specification

One of the important aspects of any interoperability testing session is to
record and process the issues found during the TestFest Event. This will allow
the corresponding Working Groups to determine how the issue should be resolved,
TestFest participants may have the opportunity to raise their queries directly
with the corresponding Technical Working Group.

> For LWM2M Test events, participants are asked to submit any issues they
encounter with the specification on the OMA GitHub
[**Issues - LwM2M for Developers**](https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/OMA_LwM2M_for_Developers/issues){target="_blank"}.
This repository  is monitored by the [Device Management Working Group](https://lwm2m.openmobilealliance.org/about/){target="_blank"}
Device Management Working Group and the [IPSO Working Group](https://lwm2m.openmobilealliance.org/about/){target="_blank"}.
